# HammerTime

## About
Moves all pieces from custom hammers to the vanilla hammer.

![hammertime](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MSchmoecker/HammerTime/master/Docs/HammerTimePreview.gif)

It is not possible to have the same pieces into different hammers with different categories.
That means the original hammers will be empty.


### Config
All config options are generated automatically after the first world loading for every custom hammer individually.
They can be changed at runtime.

Following Options are available:
- Combine Mod Categories: Combines all categories from this custom hammer into one category
- Disable PieceTable: Disables moving pieces from this custom hammer into one the vanilla hammer


## Installation
This mod requires BepInEx and JÃ¶tunn.
Extract all content of `HammerTime` into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

This is a client side only mod and does not execute on a server.


## Development
See [contributing](https://github.com/MSchmoecker/HammerTime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
